# Current status
At this point based on the example code found in the Learnosity GitHub repo the UI is trying to get security information from
the backend service located in `feature/learnosity-stack` and using that to build a request by combining it with hardcoded data also
copied directly from the GitHub example to create a "question" based API/page.

At this point the request is being created which matches those seen in all examples but how/what to call to get the API (HTML) returned is in question.
